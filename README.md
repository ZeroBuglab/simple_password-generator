# Hello! 👋  
this simple Password Generator (Python)  

A simple Python password generator that creates random passwords based on user-selected length.  
This project does not use external libraries and focuses on learning core Python logic.  

________________________

# ✨ Features  
* User chooses password length    
* Generates passwords using:    
    * Uppercase letters   
    * Lowercase letters    
    * Digits    
    * Symbols    
* Simple and beginner-friendly    
* No external dependencies    

____________________

##  🧠 How It Works    
1.	The user enters the desired password length  
2.	The program validates the input  
3.	A loop generates random characters  
4.	Characters are combined into a password  
5.	The final password is printed
